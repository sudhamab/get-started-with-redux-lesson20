/*
** THIS IS THE FILE END OF LESSON 19.
** it's not clear from the lesson 
** as to why FilterLink was defined as a function and not a React Component.
** Dan describes this as a "Functional Component" in his lesson.
** In later lessons, some components will become 
** Presentational, i.e fall under components folder , 
** and others will be more 
** Behavioral , i.e fall under containers folder. 
** Bahavioral containers will be more responsible for dispatching 
** actions, etc where as Presentational are more for the UI and 
** are just given the information they need to render.

**
** Filter -> 
** Also, Note the filter and children are passed in using the 
** destructuring syntax in javascript. More on that here -
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment
** 
** Hence from the UI, the filter value gets passed in almost like 
** how props are passed, but we don't specify proptypes or anything in the 
** FilterLink
** 
** Children -> 
** These are the text that's passed in
